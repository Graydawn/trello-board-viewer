## How to Use 🚀

This is a single HTML file that runs locally in your browser. No server or build process is needed.

### 1. Get Trello API Credentials

You need to generate a personal **API Key** and **Token** to allow the script to access your boards.

1.  Go to the [Trello Developer API Keys](https://trello.com/app-key) page.
2.  You will see your "Personal Key" under the header. This is your `API_KEY`.
3.  On that same page, click the **"Token"** link to manually generate a token.
4.  Click **"Allow"** on the next page to grant access.
5.  The page will show your token. This is your `TOKEN`.

### 2. Add Credentials to the File

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2.  Find the following lines in the `<script>` section at the bottom:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = 'API_KEY';
    const TOKEN   = 'TOKEN';
    ```
3.  Replace `'API_KEY'` and `'TOKEN'` with the credentials you just generated.

### 3. Run It

Save the file and open `index.html` in your web browser. That's it! Your Trello boards will load automatically.

## How It Works 🛠️

* The page uses the **Trello API** to fetch your boards, lists, and cards.
* It specifically looks for lists named 'Backlog', 'To Do', and 'Doing' (case-insensitive) and ignores others (like 'Done').
* **Sortable.js** (included via CDN) is used to enable the drag-and-drop functionality.
* When a card is moved to a new column or reordered, API calls are made to Trello to update the card's list (`idList`) and position (`pos`).
