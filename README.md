Trello Board Viewer
A simple, single-file HTML dashboard to get a consolidated view of all your Trello boards made with AI. It focuses on providing a clear overview of tasks in 'Backlog', 'To Do', and 'Doing' lists, with a special "Today's Focus" section to highlight all tasks you are currently working on.

How to Use 🚀
This is a single HTML file that runs locally in your browser. No server or build process is needed.

1. Get Trello API Credentials
You need to generate a personal API Key and Token to allow the script to access your boards.

Go to the Trello Developer API Keys page.

You will see your "Personal Key" under the header. This is your API_KEY.

On that same page, click the "Token" link to manually generate a token.

Click "Allow" on the next page to grant access.

The page will show your token. This is your TOKEN.

2. Add Credentials to the File
Open the index.html file in a text editor.

Find the following lines in the <script> section at the bottom:

JavaScript

const API_KEY = 'API_KEY';
const TOKEN   = 'TOKEN';
Replace 'API_KEY' and 'TOKEN' with the credentials you just generated.

3. Run It
Save the file and open index.html in your web browser. That's it! Your Trello boards will load automatically.

How It Works 🛠️
The page uses the Trello API to fetch your boards, lists, and cards.

It specifically looks for lists named 'Backlog', 'To Do', and 'Doing' (case-insensitive) and ignores others (like 'Done').

Sortable.js (included via CDN) is used to enable the drag-and-drop functionality.

When a card is moved to a new column or reordered, API calls are made to Trello to update the card's list (idList) and position (pos).
